> **Methodology finding**: AM4-Edit's UI is type-dependent —

> 0x10 → 0x13; AM4-Edit byte-exact). **BK-034 cleared as
> not-a-code-bug** — captures show our wire is byte-identical
> to AM4-Edit's; HW-014 hardware-display divergence is an AM4
> screen-rendering quirk, not a wire bug. **HW-018 added 10 new

## Current phase

**Phase 1 — Protocol RE: 🟢 COMPLETE AND HARDWARE-VERIFIED.** First real
write produced visible parameter change on the device (Session 05).

**Phase 2 — Parameter registry + preset IR + transpiler.** Registry +
working-buffer IR + transpiler shipped and capture-verified (Session 07).
Channel-addressing solved in Session 08 — channel A/B/C/D is a regular
SET_PARAM write at `pidHigh = 0x07D2` with the index (0..3) encoded as a
float32. One open question remains before the IR can cover full presets:
**bulk parameter discovery** (Ghidra metadata table extraction below).

## The single next action

**Most-likely next session: HW-034 + HW-035 + HW-036 (founder
hardware) OR BK-029 project rename to MCP MIDI Tools (no
hardware).**
HW-032 closed partial 2026-04-25 — 8 params landed plus the
Input Noise Gate identified as a new block, but 4 follow-up
threads queued (HW-034 / 035 / 036 / 037). Highest-value gap is
HW-035 (slot-Gate first-page knobs — currently only type +
balance registered for a block whose threshold / attack / release
controls are core gate functionality). Founder's "I did not have
all those options" note on HW-032 is consistent with type-
dependent UI rendering — different gate / filter types expose
different knob subsets, so a Modern Gate capture for HW-035 +
type-walk for HW-036 will likely surface more than the HW-032
captures alone. BK-029 stays the natural non-hardware fallback.

**Earlier (still applicable):**
BK-030 closed Session 30 cont 7 — connection registry, five
generic-MIDI primitive tools, and the Generic MIDI quick-start
section in the README all shipped. The rename was explicitly
gated on BK-030 landing first (so the new name doesn't
over-promise); that gate is now clear. BK-029 is the natural
next non-hardware track: rename the npm package, GitHub repo,
README headline, MCP server `name` field, and any user-visible
identifiers from "AM4 Tone Agent" to "MCP MIDI Tools". Tool
behaviour stays identical. Alternatively, the founder can run
HW-032 + HW-016 at the device — see below.

**HW-033 ✅ closed Session 30 cont 4 (Claude-side, no hardware).**
`scripts/extract-lineage.ts` now extracts wiki "Controls:" prose
into a `controls` field per lineage record. **31 drive types +
1 phaser type** have wiki-derived knob lists. New
`scripts/build-type-knobs.ts` emits `docs/TYPE-KNOBS-WIKI.md`
with `params.ts` cross-references per type — companion to the
manually-maintained `docs/TYPE-KNOBS.md`. **15 unmapped wiki
labels** surfaced (Voice / Presence / Contour / etc.) — knobs
the wiki names that `params.ts` doesn't yet register; review
candidates for future param additions. HW-031 (Ghidra type-
visibility decode) and BK-030 (generic-MIDI primitives) are
the next non-hardware-gated tracks.

**HW-030 step 1 done — partial fail. Pivot to HW-016 + lazy
HW-030 step 2.** Session 30 cont (continued) ruled out the
simplest cache-decode hypotheses for per-type knob visibility:
no per-type subset table after section 3 (only 2 bytes unparsed
in a 129 KB file), `english.laxml` is just UI strings, no other
metadata files installed by AM4-Edit. Per-type rendering logic
appears compiled into AM4-Edit.exe (21.7 MB). Partial signal:
the `extra` field per cache record correlates with "universal vs
type-dependent" knob status, but isn't a complete per-type map.
Findings + seeded type rows in **`docs/TYPE-KNOBS.md`** (new
this session). Lazy growth strategy adopted: Claude collects
type→knob rows opportunistically as captures land, doesn't try
to enumerate all 700+ block-type combos upfront. HW-022 and
HW-023 unblocked — they just append rows as new types are
encountered.

**Recommended next action: HW-016 prompts #1 + #3** (10 min
founder action) — closes the last P5-011 release gate. After
that, HW-022/023 can run any time and grow TYPE-KNOBS.md.

1. **HW-016 prompts #1 + #3 (founder, ~10 min)** — Claude
   Desktop first-turn smoke. Three prompts in three fresh
   conversations. Closes P5-011 item 5 (the last release gate
   before BK-029 rename / BK-030 generic-MIDI / BK-014 Axe-Fx II).
2. **HW-024 (founder, ~20 min)** — finish HW-014 spot-check
   residuals. Lower priority than HW-016 since none are known-
   broken; just lacks datapoints.

**Then or in parallel — remaining queue:**

- **HW-032** — capture the ~25 first-page knobs that HW-024's
  hardware-page inventories surfaced as currently-unmapped
  (Gate core: Threshold/Attenuation/Attack/Release/Hold/
  Sidechain Source/Level; Filter: Q/Order/Low Cut/High Cut/
  Level + page-2 modulation; Flanger: Manual/Mod Phase/Level;
  Enhancer: Width/Phase Invert/Pan L/Pan R/Level; Volpan
  Auto-Swell: Threshold/Attack/Taper/Level). 5 captures, ~30
  min total. Pair with HW-016 next time at the device.
- **BK-032 first-page captures (remaining)** — HW-022
  (modulation bundle) > HW-023 (secondary). Both should wait
  on HW-030 so they can be specced from a real
  type→knob-list map, not Blocks Guide guesswork. HW-019/020/021
  closed Session 30 cont.
- **HW-016 prompts #1 + #3** for P5-011 item 5 closure (Claude
  Desktop smoke). Prompt #2 effectively passed during HW-013.
- **HW-026** — single-knob capture to disambiguate the Reverb
  `pidHigh=0x0000` register left over from HW-018 (likely
  `reverb.level`). Low priority; doesn't block release.
- **HW-028** — single-knob capture to disambiguate
  `compressor.0x0017` and `compressor.0x0029` (Knee/Detector
  Type or JFET-specific knobs).
- **HW-029** — single-knob capture to disambiguate
  `drive.0x002d` (knob_0_10 in cache id=45 tail zone).

**Remaining AM4-depth queue (non-HW, gates Wave 1 device expansion
per `memory/feedback_am4_depth_gates_wave_expansion.md`):**

1. **P1-012 channel-aware param writes.** ✅ Shapes 1 + 2 shipped
   (Sessions 22–28). Shape 3 (scene-first tool) + read-helper
   remain deferred on BK-025 / BK-008.
2. **Advanced-controls capture session.** ✅ Shipped Session 29 —
   HW-015 archived, 10 new pidHighs registered (`amp.master` /
   `amp.depth` / `amp.presence` at corrected 0x1E / `amp.out_boost` /
   `amp.out_boost_level` / delay+flanger+phaser `feedback` /
   `reverb.size` / `reverb.springs` / `reverb.spring_tone`).
3. **Second unit-extension pass.** ✅ Infrastructure landed
   Session 28 cont 2 — `bipolar_percent` / `count` / `semitones`
   added to the `Unit` union. `bipolar_percent` used immediately to
   register 15 new `{block}.balance` params. Session 29 then used
   `count` for `reverb.springs` (2..6) — `count` is now wire-verified,
   not just typing infrastructure. `semitones` still awaits a named
   param.
4. **Count/semitones naming follow-up.** ✅ Partially closed
   (Session 29 cont). `reverb.shift_1` and `reverb.shift_2` (pidHighs
   0x0038 / 0x0039, semitones ±24) registered against Blocks Guide
   §Shimmer Verb Parameters — structural, no wire capture yet.
   `delay.taps`/`bit_reduction` (id=64), `phaser.order` (id=22),
   `drive.id24` (id=24), `gate.id14` (id=14), `filter.id28` (id=28)
   remain ambiguous — Blocks Guide names multiple candidates for
   several of these (e.g. delay id=64 could be Taps on Multi-Tap OR
   Bit Reduction on Mono Delay). Queued as HW-017 — cheap captures,
   low priority since these aren't front-panel essentials.
5. **HW-014 priority raised.** Session 29's correction caught a
   cache-signature mis-inference that only wire capture exposed
   (`pidHigh=0x000F` was structurally Presence-like but wire-wise
   Master). Mid and Treble at 0x000D / 0x000E are still on that
   same structural-only footing. HW-014 closes the gap.

**Release-gate scope expanded 2026-04-21 — BK-032 "AM4-Edit
first-page coverage."** Founder direction: the release target is
every parameter visible on AM4-Edit's first page for every block
type, because those are the primary controls an intermediate-to-
advanced user reaches for. This replaces the informal "amp depth
+ structurally-decoded params" framing with a precise per-block-
per-type scope. Six new HW tasks queued:

- HW-018 Reverb first-page (7 captures, 2 Spring-specific)
- HW-019 Drive first-page + EQ 1 + Advanced clip (~12)
- HW-020 Delay first-page (7; also resolves HW-017 delay id=64)
- HW-021 Compressor Config Page (8 — biggest coverage jump)
- HW-022 Modulation bundle (chorus/flanger/phaser/tremolo, ~14)
- HW-023 Secondary (wah/filter/gate/geq, ~10)

See `docs/04-BACKLOG.md` BK-032 for the full scope and
`docs/HARDWARE-TASKS.md` for each task's capture checklist.

**Then** (post-BK-032 + HW-013/014/016 release gates): BK-030
generic MIDI primitives → BK-029 rename to MCP MIDI Tools →
BK-014 Axe-Fx II → BK-031 Hydrasynth.

## Archived follow-ups (all shipped)

The four follow-ups that used to live here — `set_preset_name`
hardware test, round-trip a built preset via Z04, `apply_preset`
build, scene rename decoding — all shipped in Sessions 19–22. See
the Session 25 cont entry for tool-count history and the
HARDWARE-TASKS.md archive for HW-001..HW-009.

### What's still deferred

- **Apply/absorb discriminator (BK-008).** The AM4 wire-acks writes
  regardless of whether the target block is placed. Echo timing can't
  tell applied from absorbed. Parked; unblocks honest audible-change
  detection once cracked (likely Ghidra on AM4-Edit's response parser).
- **READ response format.** The `0x0D` READ action returns a 64-byte
  response with a 40-byte payload where the current param value is NOT
  at any fixed offset as a packed float32 (scanned all 5-byte windows
  against known values — zero matches). Not a blocker — v0.2 uses
  WRITE echoes for confirmation. Decoding unlocks a proper
  `read_param` tool.
- **PEQ and Rotary specific-knob entries.** Both blocks have confirmed
  `pidLow` (0x36, 0x56) but no Type enum. Individual knob entries
  (PEQ band freqs/gains, Rotary rate/depth) await the next unit-
  extension pass + a naming decision.
- **Advanced-control disambiguation captures.** Amp Master/Depth/
  Output Boost and per-block Feedback knobs can't be unambiguously
  mapped from cache signatures alone — queue as a dedicated capture
  session (~20 min).
- **Scene-state read-back (BK-025/BK-026).** Scene- and preset-switch
  acks carry rich state payloads that could serve as a READ-response
  workaround. Decode tentatively, not required for shipping.

**Layouts (parser is source of truth — see `scripts/parse-cache.ts`):**

- Section 3 begins at divider `f0 ff 00 00` (0x136f0 on this install),
  followed by `cabNames[256]` (all `<EMPTY>`) and `cabIds[256]` (all
  `0xff`), then a 32-byte block header at ~0x14610, then records.
- Section 3 records use a compressed 24-byte header (tc=u16 at +4,
  floats a/b/c/d at +8..+23). Float records: 32 bytes total (trailer
  u32=0 + extra u32). Enum records: u32 count + strings + u32 trailer.
- `cache-section3.json` contains `{ cabNames, cabIds, records }` where
  each record has `{ offset, block, id, typecode, kind, a, b, c, d,
  values?, extra? }`.

**17 sub-blocks (from `cache-section3.json`, summary printed by
`parse-cache.ts`):** sub-block 0 = Reverb (72 recs, id=10 enum × 79),
sub-block 1 = Delay (89 recs, id=10 enum × 29), sub-block 9 = Drive
(49 recs, id=10 enum × 78). Remaining 14 sub-blocks are Chorus/Flanger
/Pitch/EQ/Compressor/Filter candidates — role assignment still open.

**Next steps (Session 15+):**

1. Cross-reference the 4 main blocks (Amp pre-divider block 5, Reverb/
   Delay/Drive post-divider sub-blocks 0/1/9) against wire `pidLow`
   values (`0x3A`, `0x42`, `0x46`, `0x76`). Preferred heuristic:
   Drive's `id=10` enum at index 8 is `TS808` — matches `params.ts`
   Drive Type, so sub-block 9 ↔ `pidLow=0x76`. Confirm Reverb/Delay
   by capturing AM4-Edit setting Reverb Type and Delay Type and
   matching the resulting `pidHigh` to the cache record IDs.
2. Auto-generate `KNOWN_PARAMS` entries for each confirmed
   block/param. Start with Reverb and Delay since those are the most
   obvious to validate by ear.
3. After `KNOWN_PARAMS` is generated, start on **P3-007 Model lineage
   dictionary** (see `04-BACKLOG.md`) — the 248-amp × 78-drive ×
   79-reverb × 29-delay model names are ready to feed into the
   wiki-scrape pipeline for the real-world-gear-inspired-by mapping.
4. Decode the remaining ~49KB tail past 0x1f926 if it turns out to
   contain additional blocks (scene templates? preset metadata?).

## Decoded parameters and unit conventions

Live source of truth: `src/protocol/params.ts` (`KNOWN_PARAMS` + `Unit`
union). **98 hand-authored params** (Session 30 cont 2 added 5:
delay/chorus/flanger/phaser/tremolo `.tempo` enums sharing the new
`TEMPO_DIVISIONS_VALUES` 79-entry dictionary). Session 30 cont added 14:
5 drive EQ-page knobs (low_cut, bass, mid, mid_freq, treble) +
3 delay registers (level, stack_hold, ducking) + 6 compressor
registers (level, threshold, ratio, attack, release, auto_makeup);
**new unit `ratio`** added for compression ratios.
Session 30 added 10 reverb registers (HW-018) + corrected
predelay address (BK-033). Session 29 cont 2 added Amp
Advanced-panel enums `amp.tonestack_location` + `amp.master_vol_location`;
Session 29 cont added `reverb.shift_1` / `reverb.shift_2` semitones
from Blocks Guide cross-reference; Session 29 added 10 wire-verified
entries from HW-015 — `amp.master` (correcting a Session-26
mis-inference), `amp.depth`, `amp.presence` (moved to 0x1E),
`amp.out_boost_level`, `amp.out_boost` toggle, delay/flanger/phaser
`feedback`, `reverb.size`, `reverb.springs`, `reverb.spring_tone`;
Session 28 cont 2 added the universal per-block output Balance
across 15 confirmed blocks, unlocked by the new `bipolar_percent`
unit; prior passes: Session 26 added amp tone stack, drive tone/
level/mix, reverb predelay + time, universal Mix across 8 effect
blocks, LFO rates for chorus/flanger/phaser/tremolo, filter freq,
and modulation depths; Session 25 shipped P1-010 Session A generator
+ 20 seeds)
across 15 confirmed blocks, using **11 unit conventions** (`knob_0_10`,
`db`, `hz`, `seconds`, `percent`, `bipolar_percent`, `count`,
`semitones`, `ratio`, `ms`, `enum`). `count` and `semitones` are
typing-only today — cache has candidates (phaser stages, delay
voices, reverb shimmer shifts, drive bit depth) but each needs a
specific Blocks-Guide page cross-reference before naming. `ratio`
is in active use for `compressor.ratio` (1..20:1).
`pidLow` = block ID, `pidHigh` = parameter index within block;
address is preset-independent. `CACHE_PARAMS` mirrors every
cache-derivable entry (verify-cache-params = 44/44 byte-match against
KNOWN_PARAMS).
All 15 confirmed block enums (Amp 248 / Drive 78 / Reverb 79 /
Delay 29 / Chorus 20 / Flanger 32 / Phaser 17 / Wah 9 / Compressor 19 /
GEQ 18 / Filter 18 / Tremolo 7 / Enhancer 3 / Gate 4 / Volume-Pan 2)
populated from `cacheEnums.ts`. Amp Channel enum is fully populated
(0..3 ↔ A..D).

**Capture-verified entries:** `amp.gain/bass/level/channel`,
`drive.drive/type=TS808`, `reverb.mix`, `delay.time`. **Cache-derived,
structural-evidence only (awaiting P1-010 Session D hardware
spot-check):** `amp.mid/treble/presence`, all type enums, and the
expanded `drive.type` index table (only index 8 has been wire-verified).

## Recent breakthroughs

Older breakthroughs (sessions 04–08, 10–14) are archived in `SESSIONS.md`.
Sessions 15–19 (current) are kept here for fast orientation.

0000000000. **Session 25 — three non-HW release items in one pass.**

            **(a) `list_midi_ports` MCP tool + graceful AM4-not-found
            (P5-009 #1+#2).** New connection-free `listMidiPorts()` helper
            in `src/protocol/midi.ts`. Tool enumerates inputs + outputs,
            tags AM4-looking ports ("am4" / "fractal" substring), returns
            a verdict ("both visible" / "partially visible" / "no MIDI
            ports" / "AM4 not visible among N ports"). The `connectAM4()`
            "AM4 not found" error rewritten: lists common causes
            (power/USB/driver/AM4-Edit exclusivity), shows visible ports,
            and points at `list_midi_ports` + `reconnect_midi` as recovery.
            Tool count 15 → 16. Smoke-server covers the new tool.

            **(b) Startup banner extended (P5-009 #3).** `main()` now
            logs a port-detection verdict to stderr at boot — "AM4
            detected (in: ..., out: ...)" on the happy path, or one of
            three diagnostic strings on failure. Visible in Claude
            Desktop's MCP server log the moment the server launches,
            even before the first tool call.

            **(c) P1-010 Session A — bulk param registration infra.**
            `scripts/gen-params-from-cache.ts` walks every CONFIRMED
            cache block (per `docs/CACHE-BLOCKS.md`), looks up each
            record id in `src/protocol/paramNames.ts` (hand-maintained
            name table), and emits `src/protocol/cacheParams.ts` as
            generated TypeScript. Unit inference maps cache `c` to
            one of 5 Units (c=10→knob_0_10, c=100→percent, c=1000→ms,
            c=1→db, enum→enum). Records without a name in paramNames.ts
            are skipped (stay dormant until Session B). `scripts/verify-
            cache-params.ts` is a new preflight golden: it compares
            CACHE_PARAMS to KNOWN_PARAMS for shared keys and fails on
            any divergence (pidLow, pidHigh, unit, displayMin/Max,
            enumValues). 20/20 in-band KNOWN_PARAMS entries regenerate
            byte-identically from the cache. Coverage-growth path:
            add a (block, id) → name entry to paramNames.ts, run
            `npm run gen-params`, preflight proves no regression.
            npm scripts: `gen-params`, `verify-cache-params`.
            Preflight green.

000000000. **Session 24 — BK-027 phase 1 (kitchen-sink `apply_preset`).**
           `apply_preset` now accepts `slots[i].channels`, a per-channel
           param map keyed by A/B/C/D (case-insensitive), mutually
           exclusive with the legacy `channel` / `params` shapes.
           Validation is atomic and path-like ("slots[0] channels.B.gain:
           out of range [0..10]: 12"). Per-slot execution walks the
           channel map in A→B→C→D canonical order regardless of how
           the caller ordered the object keys — each letter emits a
           channel-switch write followed by its param writes, so the
           wire sequence is deterministic. Backwards-compatible: no
           existing apply_preset call shape changes behavior; this is
           purely additive. Smoke-server picked up five
           validation-path assertions (channel+channels conflict,
           params+channels conflict, channels on a block without
           channels, unknown letter, unknown param path). Preflight
           green. Phase 2 (scenes) remains blocked on HW-011 per
           backlog.

00000000. **Session 23 — tool-response trim + unified ack helper.**
          `sendCommandAndAwaitAck` generalized to
          `sendAndAwaitAck(conn, bytes, predicate)` so every tool that
          awaits an inbound SysEx ack uses one helper regardless of
          ack shape (`isCommandAck` for 18-byte addressing acks,
          `isWriteEcho` for 64-byte param / placement / switch acks).
          `switch_preset` and `switch_scene` moved off the passive-
          capture path onto predicate-based matching — their ack is
          the standard `isWriteEcho` shape per HW-006/HW-007 — so
          their happy-path response is now a single verdict line
          instead of a raw-hex dump. `set_param` and `set_block_type`
          success responses trimmed of the Session-19-era Sent/Ack/
          All-inbound hex blocks (obsolete once the echo predicate
          stabilized). Ack-less paths still carry diagnostic hex.
          Dead `sendAndCapture` helper deleted. No protocol change,
          no hardware work, no tool-count change. Preflight green.

0000000. **Session 20 (cont) — P3-007 Model Lineage Dictionary shipped.**
         `scripts/extract-lineage.ts` parses `docs/wiki/*.md` + `docs/
         manuals/Fractal-Audio-Blocks-Guide.txt` into five JSON files
         under `src/knowledge/`, cross-referenced against the canonical
         `cacheEnums.ts` catalog. Source-tagged: every qualitative field
         carries `source: 'fractal-blocks-guide' | 'fractal-wiki'` so
         the agent knows provenance. Only Fractal-authored content is
         captured; brand-authored quotes (Xotic, JHS, Macari's, etc.)
         and community-inferred genre/era tags are deliberately omitted
         per user preference for accuracy over coverage. Entries that
         don't match any canonical AM4 enum name (channel-variant
         sub-entries like "BRIT JVM OD1 ORANGE/RED/GREEN") are kept as
         flagged records rather than dropped. `npm run extract-lineage`
         regenerates the JSONs from sources.

000000. **Session 19 — three wins: ack triage, block-placement decode, new
        MCP tools.**

        **19a (ack triage):** Hardware testing via Claude Desktop produced
        four false-confirms on absent-block writes (amp.gain, drive.drive,
        flanger.type, reverb.type/Ambience). First fix attempted: tighten
        `isWriteEcho` to require `hdr4 = 0x0028` (reject the 23-byte
        receipt-echo of our own bytes, accept only the 64-byte device
        frame). Second hardware test killed that hypothesis — the AM4
        emits the 64-byte frame for absorbed writes too. Triage: ack
        presence does NOT indicate apply. Tool language reworked to be
        honest ("wire-acked; not a confirmation of audible change") and
        `set_params` no longer aborts on missing acks. Diagnostic capture
        of all inbound SysEx during the write window now included in
        every tool response. Apply/absorb detection parked as BK-008.

        **19b (block placement cracked):** Three Session-18 captures
        (block-clear, GEQ→Reverb, none→Amp) decoded into one protocol
        rule: block placement is a regular WRITE to pidLow=0x00CE,
        pidHigh=0x0010+slot-1, with the target block's own pidLow as
        the float32 value (0 = "none"). See SYSEX-MAP §6c. The decoded
        values matched the known pidLow table exactly (Reverb=0x42,
        Amp=0x3A). `buildSetBlockType` landed with 3/3 byte-exact
        `verify-msg` goldens against captured wire bytes.

        **19c (new MCP tools):** `set_block_type(position, block_type)`
        and `list_block_types` registered. Server now exposes 6 tools.
        Block-type dictionary (18 entries incl. "none") lives in
        `src/protocol/blockTypes.ts`.

        **19d (off-by-one correction):** First hardware test of
        `set_block_type` landed position 1 on device slot 2, and position
        4 (pidHigh 0x0013) produced a structurally different ack plus
        observed side effects on an unrelated slot. Concluded the three
        Session-18 captures were slots 2/3/4, not 1/2/3. Fixed base
        from `0x0010` to `0x000F` so positions 1..4 map to pidHighs
        0x0F..0x12. Re-test confirmed: compressor→slot 1, amp→slot 2,
        delay→slot 3, reverb→slot 4 all landed on the labelled AM4 slot,
        then amp.gain=6 + reverb.mix=40 both audibly applied.

        **19e (apply_preset tool):** Collapses the N block placements +
        M param writes of a full preset into a single MCP call. Takes
        `{ slots: [{ position, block_type, params? }] }`. Validates all
        input up-front (unknown block/param, out-of-range value, enum
        name typo, duplicate position) before sending any MIDI. Returns
        a per-write ack summary same shape as `set_params`. 7th MCP
        tool registered.

        **19f (save-to-slot decoded + tool):** `session-18-save-preset-
        z04.pcapng` produced one unique command: function=0x01,
        pidLow=pidHigh=0x0000, **action=0x001B**, payload = 4-byte
        uint32 LE slot index (Z04 → 103 → `67 00 00 00` raw →
        `33 40 00 00 00` packed). `buildSaveToSlot` + captured golden
        land in `verify-msg` (20/20). `save_to_slot` MCP tool is the
        8th, hard-gated to Z04 per CLAUDE.md write-safety rules until
        P1-008 (factory preset safety classification) arrives.
        Save-command ack shape still unresolved — the tool dumps all
        inbound SysEx in the 300 ms window instead of asserting.

        **19g (preset rename decoded + tool; scene rename partial):**
        `session-20-rename-preset.pcapng` produced a 60-byte unique
        command: function=0x01, pidLow=0x00CE (same block-slot
        register), pidHigh=0x000B, **action=0x000C**, hdr4=0x0024
        (36-byte raw payload). Payload = 4-byte slot index + 32-byte
        ASCII name, **space-padded** (0x20) not null-padded. Session
        `session-20-rename-scene.pcapng` shares the envelope / action
        / payload structure with a different pidHigh (0x0037) and the
        slot-index field zeroed — scenes are scoped to the working
        buffer. Only one scene captured, so scene-index → pidHigh
        mapping needs three more captures (BK-011). `buildSetPreset-
        Name` + golden in `verify-msg` (21/21). `set_preset_name` MCP
        tool is the 9th, hard-gated to Z04.

        **19h (packing bug surfaced):** The 36-byte name payload didn't
        match a single-pass `packValue` call because the sliding-window
        algorithm actually **restarts every 7 raw bytes** — chunked
        7→8 encoding. Small payloads (≤ 7 raw) were already one chunk,
        so every earlier test passed by coincidence. Added
        `packValueChunked` / `unpackValueChunked`; existing code paths
        are unaffected (all use ≤ 7 raw bytes per value). Updated
        SYSEX-MAP §6b (and new §6e) with the correct chunking rule.

        **19i (MIDI self-healing + reconnect tool):** Session 19 hardware
        test hit a stale-handle scenario after the user opened AM4-Edit
        — our cached MIDI connection still "looked open" but writes
        produced zero acks. Fixed two ways: (1) `ensureMidi()` now
        tracks consecutive ack-less writes; after 2 in a row, the next
        call closes the cached handle and opens a fresh one
        automatically. (2) New `reconnect_midi` MCP tool lets the user
        force a fresh handle on demand — surfaced in every ack-less
        tool response as a manual escape hatch. No more Claude Desktop
        restarts needed after brief AM4-Edit excursions or USB
        replugs. BK-013 closed. Server now exposes **10 tools**.

00000. **Session 18 — write-echo confirmation + 11 blocks confirmed.**
       Three sub-phases:
       
       **18a (echo protocol):** After `set_param`, listen for a 64-byte
       response with matching pidLow/pidHigh and `action=0x0001`
       within 300 ms. Presence = write took; timeout = silent-absorb
       (block not placed in active preset). Implemented via
       `receiveSysExMatching` in `midi.ts` and `isWriteEcho`
       predicate in `setParam.ts`. Covers `set_param` and
       `set_params` (per-write echo, stops on first silent-absorb).
       `read_param` removed — the AM4's READ response carries
       metadata, not current value, at any fixed offset.
       
       **18b (6 Tier-3 block Type captures):** Chorus (0x4E),
       Flanger (0x52), Phaser (0x5A), Wah (0x5E), Compressor (0x2E),
       GEQ (0x32) — each Type-dropdown change confirmed the wire
       pidLow matches the cache sub-block's position. Added 6
       KNOWN_PARAMS entries + 6 byte-exact verify-msg goldens.
       
       **18c (5 more blocks + 2 address-only):** Filter (0x72),
       Tremolo (0x6A), Enhancer (0x7A), Gate (0x92), Volume/Pan
       (0x66) — 5 more Type/Mode selectors, all with goldens.
       Parametric EQ (0x36) and Rotary (0x56) captures pinned
       their pidLows but they have no Type enum; KNOWN_PARAMS
       entries deferred until we pick specific knobs. Cache block
       roles: all 4 main S2 effect blocks + all 11 S3 effect
       sub-blocks now CONFIRMED. See `CACHE-BLOCKS.md`.
       
       Final: 17 KNOWN_PARAMS across 15 confirmed blocks; 16/16
       verify-msg goldens + 7/7 verify-echo goldens green.

000. **Type-enum dictionaries wired into params.ts** (Session 16).
     `scripts/gen-cache-enums.ts` emits `src/protocol/cacheEnums.ts`
     with AMP/DRIVE/REVERB/DELAY type arrays (248/78/79/29 entries).
     `KNOWN_PARAMS` now carries `amp.type`, `reverb.type`, `delay.type`;
     `drive.type` expanded from 1 entry to full 78-entry table;
     `delay.time` displayMax corrected from 5000 ms to 8000 ms.
     `docs/CACHE-DUMP.md` is the human-readable companion showing
     every param record for the 4 mapped blocks. Preflight green.

00. **Wire pidHigh == cache record id** (Session 15). Cross-referenced
    `KNOWN_PARAMS` against parsed cache via `scripts/map-cache-params.ts`:
    6/7 known params line up by id directly (amp.gain → cache id=11,
    amp.bass → id=12, drive.type → id=10 with 78-entry enum, …). This
    pins block → wire pidLow: Amp=S2 block 5 (tag=0x98), Drive=S3
    sub-block 9, Reverb=S3 sub-block 0, Delay=S3 sub-block 1. Two
    KNOWN_PARAMS are "out-of-band" (pidHigh not in per-block table):
    `amp.channel` (0x07D2) and `amp.level` (0x0000). The cache now
    supplies exact displayMin/displayMax/step for every in-band param
    and full enum tables (248 amps, 78 drives, 79 reverbs, 29 delays,
    138 cabs, 69 mics).
0. **Section 3 parser landed** (Session 14). `scripts/parse-cache.ts`
   now emits `cache-section3.json` with 256 user-cab names, 256 user-
   cab IDs, and 695 parameter records across 17 sub-blocks. All wire-
   visible enum strings (Reverb/Delay/Drive types, 78–79 entries each)
   are now in committed JSON. `npm run preflight` green.
1. **Post-divider region cracked — 17 blocks, 695 records**
   (Session 13). The `f0 ff 00 00` marker at 0x136f0 introduces a
   256-entry user-cab slot table (names + IDs, 0xf20 bytes), then
   Section 3 begins at 0x14610 with a **compressed 24-byte record
   header** (different from pre-divider's 24-byte-header-with-extra
   layout). Reverb Type (79), Delay Type (29), and Drive Type (78)
   all located — closing Phase 1's protocol-RE loop.
2. **All main effect blocks now enumerated.** Amp (pre-divider, 248
   models), Drive (post-divider block 9, 78 types), Reverb (block 0,
   79 types), Delay (block 1, 29 types). The catalog is ready to
   feed into `KNOWN_PARAMS` auto-generation AND the P3-007 Model
   Lineage Dictionary work.
3. **Pre-divider vs post-divider layout difference.** Pre-divider
   records use 24-byte header with tc=u32 and a/b/c/d floats at
   +8..+23. Post-divider records use 24-byte header with tc=u16 at
   +4 (not +8) and a/b/c/d floats at +8..+23 with different total
   record size (32 bytes for float). Block headers differ too:
   pre-divider is 40 bytes with tag in high 16 bits of u32 at +4;
   post-divider is 32 bytes with tag in high 16 bits of u32 at +8.
4. **Block tag ≠ wire pidLow** (Session 12, still open). Amp wire
   pidLow=0x3A but block tag=0x98. The cache's block order also
   differs from wire pidLow order. Block → wire-pidLow mapping is
   still open.

Session 08 highlights (still load-bearing):

1. **Per-block channel selector decoded** (Session 08). Channel A/B/C/D
   is a regular SET_PARAM write at `pidLow=0x003A` (Amp), `pidHigh=0x07D2`,
   with the channel index (0..3) packed as an IEEE 754 float32. Two
   captures proved it: `session-09-channel-toggle.pcapng` (A↔B) and
   `session-09-channel-toggle-a-c-d-a.pcapng` (A→C→D→A). All four values
   confirmed by `unpackFloat32LE`. `amp.channel` added to `KNOWN_PARAMS`
   with `unit: 'enum'` and `enumValues: {0:'A', 1:'B', 2:'C', 3:'D'}`;
   `verify-msg.ts` now 5/5 including checksum.
2. **pidHigh decoding correction** (Session 08). Prior to `0x07D2`, every
   observed pidHigh was ≤ 0x7F, so reading the two body bytes as
   little-endian (`(hi << 8) | lo`) gave the same answer as the correct
   septet decode (`(hi << 7) | lo`). Channel was the first param to
   expose the difference — `parse-capture.ts`'s body-hex display still
   shows the septet bytes laid out LE, so always convert with `(hi<<7)|lo`
   when extracting a new `pidHigh` from a capture. Documented in
   SYSEX-MAP.md §6a.
3. **Same pidHigh likely applies to other blocks** (Session 08, unverified).
   The other per-block selectors (Drive/Reverb/Delay) are probably at
   `pidHigh=0x07D2` on their respective `pidLow`. Worth a one-shot
   capture when expanding the registry to per-block channel keys.

## What's known (status legend)

- Device comms, checksum, envelope, model ID, documented commands
  `0x08 / 0x0C / 0x0D / 0x0E / 0x13 / 0x14 / 0x64` — **🟢 confirmed**.
- Preset dump format (`0x77/0x78/0x79`) + slot addressing — **🟢 confirmed**.
- `0x01` SET_PARAM message format + value encoding — **🟢 fully decoded**.
- Parameter ID structure — **🟢 (Session 06, preset-independent)**.
- 98 hand-authored params / 15 confirmed blocks / 11 units — **🟢 in `params.ts`** (Session 30 cont 2: HW-027 added 5 tempo enums sharing TEMPO_DIVISIONS_VALUES; Session 30 cont: HW-019/020/021 — drive EQ + delay/comp universal + comp config; new `ratio` unit).
- Channel A/B/C/D addressing — **🟢 (Session 08: Amp `pidHigh=0x07D2`,
  float32 index 0..3; other blocks' channel pidHigh unverified)**.
- Drive Type enum table — **🟡 only `8 → TS808` known**.
- Full preset binary layout inside `0x78` chunks — **🔴 scrambled, parked**.

MVP scope, target-user definition, and write-safety rules are
authoritative in `CLAUDE.md` and `DECISIONS.md` — not duplicated here.

## Roadmap landmarks

- **Strategic direction:** multi-device expansion is scoped in the
  backlog in two waves.
  - **Wave 1 — Fractal family:** BK-014 (Axe-Fx II XL+, founder-owned,
    capture-based RE like AM4) then BK-015 (Axe-Fx III / FM9 / FM3 /
    VP4 community beta). This is where the addressable market jumps
    from dozens to 6-figure guitarist populations.
  - **Wave 2 — Roland / Boss family:** BK-016 umbrella + BK-017/018/019/
    020 (RC-505 MKII, VE-500, SPD-SX, JD-Xi — all founder-owned).
    Different SysEx family from Fractal (`0x41` manufacturer vs
    Fractal's `0x00 0x01 0x74`) but structurally simpler because
    **Roland publicly publishes full MIDI Implementation PDFs** — zero
    capture-based RE per device vs the 20+ sessions we paid on AM4.
    Opens the home-studio / synth / loop segment, broadens the project
    from "Fractal tone agent" to "local MIDI gear agent."
  - Both waves require landing BK-012 (protocol package split) first,
    which becomes much more load-bearing with a second protocol family
    in scope: it becomes `fractal-protocol-core` + `roland-protocol-
    core` + per-device packages.
- **Now:** finish decoding cache Section 2 across all blocks — Session 11 cracked block 0, Session 12 needs the block-1 layout shift.
- **Then:** expand `WorkingBufferIR` → full `PresetIR` (block placement,
  4 scenes, per-block channel assignment) — the transpiler will need to
  emit a channel-select write (now understood) before that block's
  param writes.
- **Then:** scaffold MCP server (`src/server/`) with first two tools
  (`read_slot`, `apply_preset`).
- **Then:** natural-language → preset-IR (Claude side).
- **Phase 5:** packaging to signed `.exe` (see `docs/04-BACKLOG.md`).

## Where everything lives

- `src/protocol/` — verified protocol layer (checksum, pack, params, setParam, midi).
- `src/ir/` — preset IR (`preset.ts` working-buffer scope) + `transpile.ts`.
- `docs/SESSIONS.md` — every RE session, chronological, with raw captures.
- `docs/SYSEX-MAP.md` — working protocol reference (🟢/🟡/🔴 tagged).

  cache. Superseded by `parse-cache.ts` but kept for reference.
- `scripts/parse-cache.ts` — structural decoder for the cache. Parses
  Section 1 (87 global-setting records), Section 2 (465 records / 7
  blocks) and Section 3 (695 records / 17 sub-blocks + cab tables)
  cleanly into typed JSON.

  parsed cache with the pinned (pidLow → cache block) mapping, and
  dumps each main block's candidate parameter list.
- `scripts/gen-cache-enums.ts` — generates `src/protocol/cacheEnums.ts`
  and `docs/CACHE-DUMP.md` from the parsed cache JSON.
- `src/protocol/cacheEnums.ts` — generated Amp/Drive/Reverb/Delay type
  dictionaries, imported by `params.ts`.
- `docs/CACHE-DUMP.md` — committed human-readable dump of the 4 mapped
  blocks (ids, kinds, ranges, enum values).

## How to use this file

Update at the end of every substantive session:
- Change "The single next action" to the next concrete step.
- Move completed items out of "Recent breakthroughs" once they're no
  longer urgent context.
- Keep the file under ~200 lines — it's an orientation doc, not an
  archive. Archive belongs in `SESSIONS.md` and `BACKLOG.md`.
